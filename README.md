# screw-top-jar

This openscad model allows you to create a screw top jar. The size of the jar depends on one of 900+ threads available. The jar can be round or faceted. The top and the bottom can be any length you want. The size of the threaded part on both is also configurable.

## To create a jar

- Download openscad and open the scad file...
- or use the thingiverse customizer [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
- configure the details like thread and sizes...
- create an stl file and print.
